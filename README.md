## Protein-Heaven
Midterm project with colaboration of another two colleagues.
A food pick-up service. Customers select their items, and recieve a SMS with the confirmation that the order was recieved.
Restaurant admins will also recieve a SMS to alert that a new order is in the system. In the admin portal, orders can be set with an estimated time for pickup, which will send another message to the customer.
